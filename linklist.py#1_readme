Array to Linked List Conversion – Explanation

This program converts a normal Python list (array) into a singly linked list.

A linked list is a chain of nodes where each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node.

Node Class
Each node contains two parts:
• data – the value stored in the node
• next – the reference (pointer) to the next node

Creating the Linked List
The function takes an array and builds a linked list using the following steps:

Step 1: Check if the array is empty.
If the array has no elements, the function returns None because there is nothing to convert.

Step 2: Create the head node.
The first element of the array becomes the first node (head) of the linked list.

Step 3: Loop through the rest of the array.
For every remaining value in the array:
• Create a new node
• Link it to the current last node
• Move the current pointer to the newly created node

This builds the linked list one node at a time.

Step 4: Return the head node.
The head of the list gives access to the entire linked list.

Printing the Linked List
A helper function prints the linked list by starting from the head and following each next pointer until the end of the list is reached.
Each value is printed in the format:

value1 -> value2 -> value3 -> … -> last_value
