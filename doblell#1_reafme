This function converts an array into a doubly linked list.

Each node in a doubly linked list has:
• data – value of the node
• next – pointer to the next node
• prev – pointer to the previous node

Steps:

Empty Array Check
If the array is empty, return None because no list can be created.

Initialize Head and Tail
Head points to the first node of the list.
Tail keeps track of the last node for easy insertion.

Loop Through the Array
For each value in the array:
• Create a new node
• If the list is empty, set both head and tail to this node
• Otherwise:

Link the new node to the end using tail.next

Set new_node.prev to the current tail

Move tail to the new node

Return Head
Returning the head allows traversal of the entire doubly linked list.

Example:

Array:
[10, 20, 30]

Doubly Linked List:
10 ⇄ 20 ⇄ 30
