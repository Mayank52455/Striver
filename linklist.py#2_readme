Insert at End of Linked List – Explanation

This function inserts a new value at the end of a singly linked list.

Node Structure
Each node contains:
• data – the stored value
• next – pointer to the next node in the list

Creating the New Node
We first create a new node with the value we want to insert.

Empty Linked List Case
If the head is None, the list is empty.
So the new node becomes the first and only node.
We return it as the new head.

Traverse to the End
If the list already has nodes, we start from the head and move forward using the next pointer until we reach the last node (where next is None).

Insert the New Node
Once we reach the last node, we set its next pointer to the new node.
This attaches the new node at the end of the linked list.

Example
If the list is:
10 -> 20 -> 30

And we insert 40, the updated list becomes:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40
