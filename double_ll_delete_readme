Delete Node from Doubly Linked List – Explanation

This function deletes a node at a given position x from a doubly linked list.

Steps:

Invalid Case
If the list is empty or the position is invalid (x <= 0), return the list unchanged.

Delete Head Node
If x = 1, the first node is removed.
The head is moved to the next node and its prev pointer is set to None.

Traverse to the Node
Start from the head and move forward until the x-th node is reached.

Out of Range
If the position does not exist, return the original list.

Pointer Adjustment
To delete the node:
• The previous node’s next is linked to the next node
• The next node’s prev is linked to the previous node

Return Head
The head of the list is returned after deletion
